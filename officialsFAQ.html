                <h3 class="text-primary-emphasis fst-italic">Welcome!</h3>
                <p>Glad to hear you're interested in joining us.  There are several steps involved, but each is manageable on its own; just 
                  take things one step at a time.  Answers to most questions you'll encounter can be found on the 
                  <a href="https://www.gomotionapp.com/team/gslsc/page/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gulf Swimming</a> web page, 
                  but feel free to reach out to Alex Fuller (<a href="mailto:splash01@gmail.com">splash01@gmail.com</a>) for help.  Here are the steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Create a USA Swimming account.  Use this link to be associated with our team.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>If you already are a member, let the Gulf Registrar, Loren Fichbach (<a href="mailto:loren.fischbach@gulfswimming.org">loren.fischbach@gulfswimming.org</a>), know your ID and that you'd like to be associated with FCST.</p></li>
                            <li><p class="text-primary-emphasis fst-italic">When you complete your training FCST will reimburse the cost of registration.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Complete the Background Check.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>USA Swimming, Gulf Swimming, and FCST take SafeSport seriously.  The background check is one way we 
                              protect our kids.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Log into your USA Swimming account.  Under the Education/Course Catalog menu, find the Background 
                              Check class.  To easily find it, type "background" in the Search Courses by Name field.  Complete the 
                              form for the background check.</p></li>
                            <li><p class="text-primary-emphasis fst-italic">When you complete your training FCST will 
                              reimburse the cost of the background check.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Complete the SafeSport training class.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Log into your USA Swimming account.  Under the Education/Course Catalog menu, find the Athlete 
                              Protection Training class by clicking on the Safe Sport icon and looking for "Athlete Protection Training."</p></li>
                            <li><p>Be a little bit careful here because there are quite a few courses.  Some are labelled as 
                              "Refresher" courses, and you do not want one of those.  Other courses include SafeSport for 
                              Volunteers and Parents Guide to Misconduct in Sport.  Some of these you may even have taken 
                              previously.  To become an official, you must take the "Athlete Protection Training" course.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Once you complete that much, we can allow you on deck to begin training.  However, there are a couple of 
                  additional steps you'll need to complete before you can receive training credit for sessions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>Complete Concussion Protocol Training.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>This also begins in USA Swimming's Education/Course Catalog but goes to an external web site.  
                              You may take either the CDC version or the National Federation of State High School Associations 
                              course.  You may have to create an account with one of these organizations.</p></li>
                            <li><p>When done, you'll receive a certificate and/or completion notice.  Send that to Loren 
                              Fichbach (<a href="mailto:loren.fischbach@gulfswimming.org">loren.fischbach@gulfswimming.org</a>).</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>Complete the Foundations of Officiating course and the Stroke & Turn courses.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Each of these will be an interactive course with a quiz at the end.  The quizzes are open book 
                              and are designed to teach some of what you may see on deck, as well as the basic philosophy of officiating.</p></li>
                            <li><p>When completed, the courses will give you a completion certificate or notification.  Send them 
                              to Natalie Melenric, our Gulf Officials Coordinator, at 
                              <a href="mailto:officials@gulfswimming.org">officials@gulfswimming.org</a>.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>At this point, you'll be considered an Apprentice Stroke and Turn official.  The next steps are to obtain the 
                  uniform and to sign up for a meet.  The meet referee will assign you one or more certified officials to "shadow."  
                  You'll be on deck and standing beside the official.  They will point out what they are looking for during various 
                  events and you will be able to hear the disqualification phraseology.  Take it slow, learn everything you 
                  can from each official.  You're on deck and have the best seat in the house!</p>

                <p>For most meets, we wear a white polo or golf-style shirt with navy blue shorts, pants, or a skirt.  Shoes 
                  should be mostly white and should not be sandles.  Many ask about white "Crocs."  These will usually be 
                  allowed, but not always.  It is up to the meet referee.</p>
                <p>In championship season, we change it up a little bit.  Preliminary sessions will use the same white 
                  shirt, but khaki shorts, pants, or a skirt are needed.  For finals sessions, it will be a navy blue 
                  shirt.  Many times the meet announcement says that only khaki pants and skirts are allowed in finals
                  (no shorts!).  Check your meet announcement for details.</p>

                <p>It's up to you.  If you wish, you can remain at the Stroke and Turn position and continue to have an 
                  impact on swimmers.  You can also advance to other positions on deck.  Do you like having all eyes on 
                  you?  Starters get to be the centers of attention.  If you're really into middle management, you can be 
                  a Chief Judge.  Maybe you like air conditioning, chairs, and long hours in front computer screens?  
                  Administrative officiating might be right for you.  Or, you can channel your inner five-year-old to 
                  see how loudly you can blow a whistle as a Referee.</p>

                                <li><p class="fs-5 text-primary-emphasis fst-italic">Starter</p>
                                    <p>This is the most common position to pursue after obtaining a Stroke & Turn certification.  
                                      The starter is responsible for [shockingly!] starting the heat in a fair, consistent manner.  
                                      After the referee raises his or her arm, the pool belongs to the starter who delivers the 
                                      "Take your marks" command with a calm, inviting tone.  When the field is set, he or she 
                                      presses the button that launches the heat.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p class="fs-5 text-primary-emphasis fst-italic">Chief Judge</p>
                                    <p>The Chief Judge certification may also be pursued by certified Stroke & Turn officials.  
                                      The "CJ" assists the Referee in vetting calls for accuracy as well as mentoring and caring 
                                      for the well-being of other officials.<p>

                                <li><p class="fs-5 text-primary-emphasis fst-italic">Administrative Official</p>
                                    <p>Admin Officials work before, during, and after meets to make sure swimmers are properly 
                                      entered, heats are seeded, times are correct, and results are properly scored.  Ever wondered 
                                      how results get into Meet Mobile?  What happens once your swimmer circles in for an event?  
                                      What happens to all those timer sheets collected by runners?  The Admin Officials are 
                                      responsible for all of these things.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p class="fs-5 text-primary-emphasis fst-italic">Referee</p>
                                    <p>This level comes in two flavors.  As a Deck Referee, you are in charge of a pool.  You 
                                      control the pace of the meet and your job is to advocate for the swimmers by ensuring they 
                                      are always given the benefit of the doubt.  Experienced Deck Referees may wish to become Meet
                                      Referees.  These are generally the most experienced local officials and take the responsibility
                                      for running entire meets.  As a qualified Referee, you can do either job.</p>

                <p>The Officials Tracking System (OTS) is used to track meets, sessions, and certifications.  Each 
                  time you work at a meet, the meet referee should give you credit for working at one or more sessions.  
                  He or she will also assign a role for each session.  While you might work in multiple roles within a 
                  given session, OTS is only able to accept a single role.  Coordinate with the meet referee to 
                  receive the session credit you desire.</p>
